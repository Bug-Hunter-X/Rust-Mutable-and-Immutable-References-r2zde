This repository contains example code demonstrating a common error in Rust related to mutable and immutable references. The `bug.rs` file shows the error scenario and `bugSolution.rs` demonstrates the correction.  The primary issue stems from attempting to create a mutable reference to an immutable value or trying to modify a value via an immutable reference.  Understanding this distinction is crucial for writing safe and correct Rust code.
